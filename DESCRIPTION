Description: Multiblock data analysis concerns the analysis of
    several sets of variables (blocks) observed on the same group of
    individuals. The main aims of the RGCCA package are: (i) to study the
    relationships between blocks and (ii) to identify subsets of variables
    of each block which are active in their relationships with the other
    blocks.
