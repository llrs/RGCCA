Description: Multiblock data analysis concerns the analysis of several
    sets of variables (blocks) observed on the same group of individuals.
    The main aims of the RGCCA package are: (i) to study the relationships
    between blocks and (ii) to identify subsets of variables of each block
    which are active in their relationships with the other blocks.
